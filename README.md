## Hi there, I'm Mikhail 👋

I’m a **backend developer**. I primarily work on web applications, analytics platforms, chatbots and web scrapers. 

I work mostly in **Python** using FastAPI and Django frameworks, Docker, various DBMSs including PostgreSQL and Neo4j, message brokers, related libraries and tools. I enjoy diving into computer science topics and solving algorithmic challenges on [codewars](https://codewars.com/users/profatsky).

I've participated in over **15 hackathons** and won many of them 🏆  
My team has own website: [жыбийрыр.рф](https://жыбийрыр.рф) – where you can find our portfolio and hackathon victories!
